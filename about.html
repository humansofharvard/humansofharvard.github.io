<p>Humans of Harvard aims to catch a glimpse into the stories of the Harvard community and to pay forward tidbits of gratitude by letting people know they are appreciated. At any given time, you can submit a letter of gratitude to our website, and every few stories, we’ll meet with individuals to find out who they are thankful for.. By the first Thursday of each month, we will print and deliver all the notes of gratitude both from our conversations and our website as well as add your story to the chain of other thankful notes on our Facebook page. We hope that Humans of Harvard can make your day a little brighter.</p>
