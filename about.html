  Humans of Harvard aims to catch a glimpse into the stories of the Harvard community and to pay forward tidbits of gratitude
  by letting people know they are appreciated. At any given time, you can submit a letter of gratitude to our website, and
  every few stories, we’ll meet with individuals to find out who they are thankful for.. By the first Thursday of each month,
  we will print and deliver all the notes of gratitude both from our conversations and our website as well as add your story
  to the chain of other thankful notes on our Facebook page. We hope that Humans of Harvard can make your day a little
  brighter.

<p> <b> FAQs </b></p>

<p> <em> Who can submit a story or gratitude letter? </em> </p>
<p> Although we currently act as a platform for members of the Harvard community, anyone can! </p>


<p> <em> What do we feature? </em> </p>
<p> We have both stories and gratitude letters on our FB page and website.
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b> STORIES </b>: We hope that stories give you the chance to express
      anything about your life that you feel comfortable sharing.
      These stories can be about anything - maybe a rough time you went
      through, some advice you wish to share with others, or perhaps just
      something that happened to you today.
    </li>

    <li>
      <b> GRATITUDE LETTERS </b>: These letters are our aim to pass along some tidbit of
      appreciation to someone you might not always acknowledge. By letting someone else
      know that he or she matters to you, not only can you feel more grateful but also
      the other person feels loved.
    </li>

  Humans of Harvard strives to be a safe space that promotes happiness and well-being
  in the Harvard community.

<p> <em> How does this work? </em> </p>
<p>
  If you want to submit a story or a gratitude letter, just click on the 'Submit' tab in
  the Menu bar. Fill out the relevant information for whichever submission, story or gratitude letter.
  If you fill out a gratitude letter, there is additional information for you to read and fill out.
</p>

<p> <em> Can submissions be anonymous? </em> </p>
<p>
  Stories can definitely be anonymous if you want them to! Gratitude letters can be anonymous
  too but we hope that you will fill out your name so the person who you appreciate will know that
  you appreciate them!
</p>
