      <b style="color:#DC143C">HUMANS OF HARVARD</b> aims to capture the stories
      of the Harvard community and to spread gratitude within the community. At
      any given time, you can submit a letter of gratitude to our website, and
      before the first Thursday of each month, we will print and mail the notes
      of gratitudes. We will also be around campus and will post a few stories a week.
      We hope that Humans of Harvard can make your day a little brighter.
